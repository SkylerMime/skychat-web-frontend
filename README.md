# skychat-web-frontend

The frontend for my web-based chat application (see skychat-web-backend for the corresponding backend)

Run on `http://localhost:5173` with `npm run dev` or build with `npm run build` and then serve the static files by any method.

Ensure skychat-web-backend and the mongodb instance are both running on the proper URLs and ports.
