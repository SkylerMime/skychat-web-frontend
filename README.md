# skychat-web-frontend

The frontend for my web-based chat application (see skychat-web-backend for the corresponding backend)

By default, runs on `http://localhost:5173`

To run in development mode: `npm run dev`
To run in production mode: `npm run build` and then serve the static files by any method.

Ensure skychat-web-backend and the mongodb instance are both running on the proper URLs and ports.
